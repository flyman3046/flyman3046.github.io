      <p>DeepLearning4J seems like a pretty interesting project and I just gave a shot and made a simple digit recognition Android app. Here are some useful resources I found:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart">It talks about how to open an existing project from DeepLearning4J examples.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/mnist-for-beginners">It shows the example of MNIST. Following this example, you can train the neural network.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/modelpersistence">How to save/read model</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/android">It has an example of how to train the model in Android. I did not train the model in Android, since it is time- and resource-consuming. I pretrained the model in my desktop and then copied it to Android phone. After that, loading the model from the app, and predict the digit. </a></li>
</ol>

<p>The Android app is <a href="https://github.com/flyman3046/MNIST_DL4J">here</a>. The model is put <a href="https://github.com/flyman3046/MNIST_DL4J/tree/master/app/src/main/res/raw">here</a>.</p>
